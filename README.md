Description

This project is a simple Grade Calculator built using Python. It takes marks as input from the user, validates them, and determines the appropriate grade using conditional statements, logical operators, and nested conditions. The code is refactored into functions to improve readability and maintainability.

🧠 Concepts Covered

User input handling

if-elif-else conditional statements

Logical operators (and, or)

Nested conditions for real-world grading rules

Input validation for invalid marks

Basic error handling using try-except

Function-based refactoring
